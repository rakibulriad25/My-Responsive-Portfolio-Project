# Personal Responsive Portfolio

Hey guys! This my personal portfolio made with HTML, CSS and Javascript. ðŸ˜€


The main focus of this portfolio while building was responsiveness. The website not only looks modern and interactive in Desktop screen (Large Screen Sizes) but also in Mobile Devices (Small Screen Sizes). 

This is an assignment for University Course. I'm taking it further by owning it and make it more professional and minimalistic. I hope you like my work!

Thanks.
